                <h2>Debounce handler</h2>
                <p>Debouncing is a form of rate-limiting to prevent some action
                being taken more often than necessary.  Mostly on a website
                this is used on form inputs where a user may type several
                characters and have costly actions performed (like search
                suggestions).  The idea here is that a set amount of time
                after the last character has been entered, do we actually
                do the action (searching, etc).
                </p>
                <p>
                Enter some text and a second after your <em>last</em> keypress,
                a little message will appear briefly:
                <input type="text" class="debounce__input">
                <span class="debounce__activity alert alert--success fader">Bounced!</span>
                </p>
                <pre>const CreateDebounce = (callback, timeout = 300) => {
   let timeoutId;
   return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
      timeoutId = setTimeout(callback, timeout);
   }
}</pre>

                <p>That's the core of it. This is a really simple function
                that holds 2 pieces of state: a timeout ID returned by the 
                <code>window.setTimeout</code> function, and the timeout passed 
                in when creating the debounce. When the inner function is called,
                we just reset the timer to make sure the callback function isn't 
                called, then set a new timer that will trigger later.  The end 
                result being that after the final keypress by the user, after
                <code>timeout</code> milliseconds, the callback function we 
                passed in is executed.
                </p>

                <p>
                Usage is slightly longer winded, but simple enough.  First we'll
                create a callback function.  In this demo it'll just give us an
                alert, but it would really be your long-lived ajax request or
                heavy data process.  Next we create the Debounce object by
                passing in our callback and the timeout (300ms is a good value
                for key presses, any longer and you can really "feel" it, any 
                less and slow typers won't get the benefit from it). Finally,
                set the event handler on your element to the debounce function:</p>

                <pre>const DebounceCallback = () => {
   alert('I have debounced!');
}

const Debounce = CreateDebounce(DebounceCallback,1000);

document.querySelector('.debounce__input').addEventListener('keyup', Debounce);</pre>

                <p>
                    It should be obvious that this is a pure javascript feature, no specific CSS or HTML
                    is required, other than stitching together a UI element to the Debounce feature if
                    needed for your implementation.
